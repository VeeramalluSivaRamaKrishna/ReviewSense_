# ReviewSense_
ReviewSense is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes user-written reviews (about restaurants, movies, tourist spots, etc.) and classifies them as positive or negative. This helps users quickly understand the overall sentiment of a review without reading long paragraphs.
